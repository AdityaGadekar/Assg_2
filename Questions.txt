1> Write a function to implement pass by value & pass by pointer using struct.

2> Implement stack using struct and methods (push and pop).

3> Spawn N goroutines to calculate the sum of integers from an array of 100+
elements by dividing the array into N slices, (1 < n < 20).

4> Write a consumer function returning a send only channel and consume the
values by spawning a goroutine in consumer function call.

5> Write a goroutine to combine the values from two channels and
send on one separate channel, range over the third channel in main routine.
